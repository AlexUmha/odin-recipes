    <p>Chef John from Food Wishes strikes yet again with some damn good chicken. As a self-proclaimed poultry fanatic myself, I've found my standards have remained both consistent and high over the years; not just any chicken will sate me. One needn't worry with this recipe, however. It's easy to make, it's filling, it's unique, and most importantly, it's tasty.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne</li>
        <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>6 sage leaves (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp minced shallot or onion</li>
        <li>1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cups apple cider</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup apple cider vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken on both sides with salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt 3 tbsp butter in skillet over med. heat; add sage leaves and fry until crisp, 1-2 minutes. Remove and reserve.</li>
        <li>Add chicken breasts to same skillet, cook until just cooked through - about 4 minutes per side. Remove to plate, cover loosely with foil.</li>
        <li>Add shallots to skillet, saut&eacute; for 1 minute. Pour in cider, vinegar, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook until half-reduced, then reduce heat to low and place chicken back in, along with accumulated juices from plate. Cook for a few minutes, turning occasionally, basting with the sauce until the chicken is hot. Thermometer should read 165&deg; at center. Add to serving plate.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 1tbsp butter to pan, turn off heat. Swirl until butter emulsifies into the sauce; taste for seasoning and serve on chicken, garnished with fried sage.</li>
    </ol>
